// Qusition: why do we say java is platform-independent?




/*
 * Answer: It meant you could create a Java program on, letâ€™s say, 
 * Windows, compile it to bytecode, 
 * and run the application on any other platform that 
 * supports a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
 * In this case, 
 * a JVM serves as an abstraction level 
 * between the code and the hardware.
