i'm going to explain all the questions that are flagged as Exercises and then answer them,
these are questions that you wont be able to find thier answers in book itself and located in the end of every chapter.

My first goal of doing this is to learn by solving all examples, and thats what i suggust you too. but i decided to share
my answers publicly with internet users so if someone ever needed help with these exercises have access to help.
and also for people around the world who are in the journy of learning Java language(like myself) these repository can
act as a place where you can find step by step easy questions with their answers; that by solvig them can improve your
programming skills in java.


this book contains beginner to intermediate concepts of java and Object Oriented Programming. it starts with defining variables
and continues to control flow, useful java classes, arrays, heredity and polymorphism, GUI applications, Applets and etc

**list of chapters can be found below**
> coming soon...

## contribution
every type of contribiuting is welcomed :D
fix typo, add your answer and even sharing extra questions can help this repo to become more and more useful for different people.

#### **Help needed**
i'm not native english speaker, and translating these questions from Persian to English. so i belive rewriting questions in a better
form is relly necessary.
